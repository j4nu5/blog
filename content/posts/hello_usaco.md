I love competitive programming. I love the anticipation while I wait with my
fingers crossed after submitting a solution. And the rush that follows after
getting an 'AC'.

After stagnating near the 60-70th percentile for eons, I have decided to
dedicate focused practice time for competitive programming. The next series
of blog posts will track my journey through [USACO](http://www.usaco.org/).

All the best to me!
